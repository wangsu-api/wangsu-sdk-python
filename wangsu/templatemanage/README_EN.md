## Quick Start

### Example

The SDK uses AKSK authentication. You need to configure your access key and secret key:

```python
import json
from wangsu.common.auth.AkSkConfig import AkSkConfig
from wangsu.common.auth.AkSkAuth import AkSkAuth
from wangsu.templatemanage.models import *

# Refer to the API list at the end of this document and modify the corresponding {ActionName}, Method, Uri
request = {ActionName}Request()

aksk_config = AkSkConfig()
aksk_config.access_key = "YOUR_ACCESS_KEY"
aksk_config.secret_key = "YOUR_SECRET_KEY"
aksk_config.uri = "/your/api/path"
aksk_config.method = "GET"  # HTTP method: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.

# Convert request to JSON and make the API call
response = AkSkAuth.invoke(aksk_config, json.dumps(request.to_map()))
print(response)

```



## API List
For detailed API documentation and available methods, please refer to the [official Wangsu API documentation](https://www.wangsu.com/document/api-doc/Overview?productType=all).

| ActionName | enDescription | client_methods | uri |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Vmpquerynodeservers | Query the number of instances that a certain node can create of a certain specification, for you to use as a reference for instance creation. Due to real-time changes in node resources, the return value of this interface is for reference only.<br>By entering the province and nodename fields, as long as one item is filled in, the results can be queried normally. If neither item is filled in, an error will be returned. | GET | /vmp/servers_count |
