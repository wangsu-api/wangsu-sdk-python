## Quick Start

### Example

The SDK uses AKSK authentication. You need to configure your access key and secret key:

```python
import json
from wangsu.common.auth.AkSkConfig import AkSkConfig
from wangsu.common.auth.AkSkAuth import AkSkAuth
from wangsu.agent.models import *

# Refer to the API list at the end of this document and modify the corresponding {ActionName}, Method, Uri
request = {ActionName}Request()

aksk_config = AkSkConfig()
aksk_config.access_key = "YOUR_ACCESS_KEY"
aksk_config.secret_key = "YOUR_SECRET_KEY"
aksk_config.uri = "/your/api/path"
aksk_config.method = "GET"  # HTTP method: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.

# Convert request to JSON and make the API call
response = AkSkAuth.invoke(aksk_config, json.dumps(request.to_map()))
print(response)

```
