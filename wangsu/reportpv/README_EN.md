## Quick Start

### Example

The SDK uses AKSK authentication. You need to configure your access key and secret key:

```python
import json
from wangsu.common.auth.AkSkConfig import AkSkConfig
from wangsu.common.auth.AkSkAuth import AkSkAuth
from wangsu.reportpv.models import *

# Refer to the API list at the end of this document and modify the corresponding {ActionName}, Method, Uri
request = {ActionName}Request()

aksk_config = AkSkConfig()
aksk_config.access_key = "YOUR_ACCESS_KEY"
aksk_config.secret_key = "YOUR_SECRET_KEY"
aksk_config.uri = "/your/api/path"
aksk_config.method = "GET"  # HTTP method: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.

# Convert request to JSON and make the API call
response = AkSkAuth.invoke(aksk_config, json.dumps(request.to_map()))
print(response)

```



## API List
For detailed API documentation and available methods, please refer to the [official Wangsu API documentation](https://www.wangsu.com/document/api-doc/Overview?productType=all).

| ActionName | enDescription | client_methods | uri |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Querydomainuv | Query the number of unique visitors (UV) for multiple domains. Users specify domains and a time range, with data granularity options of 1 hour or 1 day. Results include total UVs per domain, UV peak, and UVs for each time slice, useful for monitoring or analyzing website visits. | POST | /api/report/uv |
| Reportdomainpvservice | Query PV (page views) statistics for multiple domain. The user provides a time range and a specified domain. The result includes the number of PVs for each domain in each time period, and the data granularity is hourly. This interface is suitable for scenarios where you need to understand the user access status of a website or application in different time periods. | POST | /api/report/domain/pv |
